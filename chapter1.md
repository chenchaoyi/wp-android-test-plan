# Test strategy

---

**WordPress Android app** is a 100% [open source project](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android), the majority of the exploratory testing will be depended on dogfooding.

The **complete test scenarios** in this test plan are intended to serve as a reference or guidance to inspire test ideas. They are not designed to be strictly followed as a to do list while performing the test, but mostly as a reference resource among different teams, with better visibility.

The **key user flows** identified by this test plan will be performed before each release, and 100% covered in test automation, ideally to be enforced as Pull Request verification too.

The following areas will be performed with exploratory mode too:
* Security
* Accessibility rules violation scan
* Devices coverage
* Low network bandwidth connection 
* Power consumption
* Mobile data usage
