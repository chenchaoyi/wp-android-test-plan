# Test strategy

---

**WordPress Android app** is a 100% [open source project](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android), the majority of the exploratory testing will be depended on dogfooding.

The **complete test scenarios** in this test plan aim to serve as a reference or guidance to the test ideas. It is not designed to be strictly followed while performing the test, but mostly as a reference resource among different teams, with better visibility.

The **key user flows** identified by this test plan will be performed before each release, and 100% covered in automation, ideally to be set as Pull Request verification too.

The following areas will be performed with exploratory mode too:

* Security
* Devices coverage
* Low network bandwidth connection 
* Power consumption
* Mobile data usage
