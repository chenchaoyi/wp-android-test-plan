# Test strategy

---

**WordPress Android app** is a 100% [open source project](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android), the majority of the exploratory testing will be depended on [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food). 

The complete test scenarios in this test plan could give you some ideas of test coverage. It is not designed to be strictly followed while doing the test, but mostly as a reference resource among different teams, with better visibility.

The **key user flows** identified by this test plan will be performed before each release, and covered in automation in ideal situation.

The following areas will be performed with exploratory mode too:

* Security
* Devices coverage
*
