# 06 - Gallery setting not obvious
----
- **Severity:** Low
- **Category:** Usability observation

After select images to be added to image gallery, the `Gallery setting` button at the bottom is not very obvious. Without the arrow on it in the first place, user hardly notices it has a pull up settings menu:
![](/assets/gallerysetting.jpg) 

After click on it, and pull down the menu, it will show the arrow. If we show this arrow in the first place, it will make it more clear and obvious to the user:
![](/assets/gallerysetting2.jpg)
