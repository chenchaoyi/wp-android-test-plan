# 05 - Too many options after clicking on 'insert media'
----
- **Severity:** Low
- **Category:** Usability observation

After click on `insert media` in the new post, there are **7** different ways of adding media to choose from, which is too many and unnecessary:
- Do we really need to separate photo from video?
- `Select a photo from gallery` and `Select from media library` cause confusion to regular user
- `Multi-select with the new picker` gives me the feeling that this option is not 100% ready so we have to keep a `Select a photo from gallery` option to be safe
