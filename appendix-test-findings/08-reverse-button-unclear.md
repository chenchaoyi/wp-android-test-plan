# 08 - Reverse button in Gallery setting is not clear on what it does
----
- **Severity:** Low
- **Category:** Usability observation

The `REVERSE` button in Gallery settings is not clear to the user what it actually does. After clicking on it, there is no visual effect change to be seen, user will be likely to try it multiple times which could revert the effect and causes more confusion.

And I not quite clear why only this option is all capital letters.
