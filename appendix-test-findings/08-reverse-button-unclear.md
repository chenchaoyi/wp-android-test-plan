# 08 - Reverse button in Gallery setting is not clear on what it does
----
- **Severity:** Low
- **Category:** Usability observation

After select image to be added to image gallery, the `Gallery setting` button at the bottom is not very obvious. Without the arrow on it in the first place, user hardly notices it has a pull up settings menu:
![](/assets/gallerysetting.jpg) 

After click on it, and pull down the menu, it will show the arrow. If we show this arrow in the first place, it will make it more obvious:
![](/assets/reverse.jpg)
