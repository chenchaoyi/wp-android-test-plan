# 04 - No Cancel option during the gallery creation process
----
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** Usability observation

Currently, there is no **Cancel** option after the user clicks on `add media` and start the gallery creation process.

If a user decides to abort the process and go back to the new post, it still goes back the the `Edit gallery` step, even no image is selected, which is quite confusing.
