### How to automate

For Android UI test automation, since WP is mostly an Android native app, the first choice would be [**Espresso**](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-testing/espresso-testing.html), which relies on **IdlingResource interface** implementation across the app, so Espresso tests could easily register to it for easy synchronized waiting.

However this is not the case for the current WP Android app, plus the entire POST editor is a webview, which requires further adoption of **Espresso-Web**.



### Automation status

Currently, an [**Appium**](http://appium.io/) Javascript solution has been created as in https://github.com/chenchaoyi/wp-android-tests.

Since WP Android app has well-organized **content-desc** attribute to most of the key elements, the locators are surprisingly easy to find. The current solution has implemented an example of an entire gallery creation flow, a screencast of its live action could be find in https://www.dropbox.com/s/fvsc941tufa3fq6/wp_android_appium.mp4.

The structure of the solution is as follows:

> ```
> ├── config
> │ ├── default.json
> │ └── testData.json
> ├── lib
> │ ├── index.js
> │ └── pages
> │  ├── editor.js
> │  ├── general.js
> │  ├── mysite.js
> │  └── signin.js
> └── test
>  ├── mocha.opts
>  ├── test.js
>  └── wp
>   └── publish.js
> ```

Page object convention is followed as all pages are defined under `lib/pages`, and all test suites are placed under `test/wp`.
