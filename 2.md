### How to automat

For Android UI test automation, since WP is mostly a Java native app, the first choice would be [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-testing/espresso-testing.html). If **IdlingResource interface** has been broadly implemented across the app, so Espresso tests could easily register to it for easy synchronized waiting. However this is not the case for the current WP Android app, plus the entire POST editor is a webview, which requires further adoption of Espresso-web, which is heavily depended on **IdlingResource** interface implementation across the app code to give the Espresso tests more control over synchronization. However, this is not the case currently in WP Android app. Plus the entire post editor is a WebView, which requires Espresso-web.

### Automation status

Currently, an [**Appium**](http://appium.io/) solution has been createcreated as in https://github.com/chenchaoyi/wp-android-tests. 

Since WP Android app has well-organized **content-desc** attribute to most of the key elements, the locators are surprisingly easy to find. The current solution has implemented an example of an entire gallery creation flow, a screencast of its live action could be find https://www.dropbox.com/s/fvsc941tufa3fq6/wp_android_appium.mp4?dl=0.

The structure of the solution is as follows:

> ```
> ├── config
> │ ├── default.json
> │ └── testData.json
> ├── lib
> │ ├── index.js
> │ └── pages
> │ ├── editor.js
> │ ├── general.js
> │ ├── mysite.js
> │ └── signin.js
> └── test
> ├── mocha.opts
> ├── test.js
> └── wp
> └── publish.js
> ```

It adopts page object convention, all pages are defined under `lib/pages`, and all test suites will be placed under `test/wp`.
