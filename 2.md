### How to automate

For Android UI test automation, since WP is mostly an Android native app, the first choice would be [**Espresso**](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-testing/espresso-testing.html), which relies on **IdlingResource interface** implementation across the app, so Espresso tests could easily register to it for easy synchronized waiting.

However this is not the case for the current WP Android app, plus the entire POST editor is a webview, which requires further adoption of **Espresso-Web**. 

We also did a trial for a [**Appium**](http://appium.io/) solution and found WP Android app has well-organized **content-desc** attribute to most of the key elements, the locators are surprisingly easy to find.

Consider the current selenium based [WordPress.com e2e test automation](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-e2e-tests) are in Javascript, it would be better to use the same language for the Appium based mobile test automation.

An Appium solution would also make use of the current Sauce Labs infrastructure quickly, while with Espresso, a totally different infrastructure like [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) needs to be looked into.

As a result, we decided to go with a **Javascript Appium solution** for the first stage, while we will keep making effort to look into the Android app code base and make a more practical Espresso solution.



### Automation status

Currently, an Appium Javascript solution has been created as in https://github.com/chenchaoyi/wp-android-tests.

It has implemented a complete flow of publishing new post with an image gallery. A screencast of its live action could be find in https://www.dropbox.com/s/fvsc941tufa3fq6/wp_android_appium.mp4.

The structure of the solution is as follows:

> ```
> ├── config
> │ ├── default.json
> │ └── testData.json
> ├── lib
> │ ├── index.js
> │ └── pages
> │  ├── editor.js
> │  ├── general.js
> │  ├── mysite.js
> │  └── signin.js
> └── test
>  ├── mocha.opts
>  ├── test.js
>  └── wp
>   └── publish.js
> ```

Page object convention is followed as all pages are defined under `lib/pages`, and all test suites are placed under `test/wp`.
